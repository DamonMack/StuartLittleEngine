# The Stuart Little Engine

## Description
The Stuart Little Engine is a game engine for creating 2D platforming games. It has been coded from scratch using C++ and Python3, with SDL2 to help manage the windows. The purpose of the engine is to allow a programmer with no C++ experience to create a game that can still leverage C++ performance. To do this, we are using the Pybind11 library to compile C++ code into libraries for Python programming. We have also created tools for creating and animating sprites, as well as for building tile maps.
